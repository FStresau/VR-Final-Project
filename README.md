# VR Test Environment  

### Project Overview  
This VR test environment was created as part of a final project for a VR class. The goal was to design an interactive and engaging virtual environment that demonstrates the core features and capabilities of a VR system, including synced hand controls, physics interactions, and locomotion mechanics.

## Features  

### 1. Hand Sync with Button Presses  
- Created virtual hands that sync perfectly with button presses on the VR controllers.  
- Provides tactile feedback and visual representation of user input.  

### 2. Camera Rigged to Headset  
- The camera follows the headset's direction, allowing users to look around seamlessly.  
- Ensures an immersive VR experience with natural head tracking.  

### 3. Toy Gun with Interactive Mechanics  
- A grab-and-use toy gun that shoots bullets when the trigger is pressed.  
- Bullets interact with the environment, allowing users to:  
  - Knock over blocks.  
  - Experiment with projectile physics.  

### 4. Ball with Bouncing Physics  
- Designed a ball with realistic bouncing physics.  
- Players can pick up and throw the ball into a basketball hoop, simulating a fun and interactive challenge.  

### 5. Teleport and Locomotion Features  
- **Teleportation System**:  
  - Allows users to teleport to a designated show area by holding down the teleport button.  
  - Quick and intuitive movement for exploring the environment.  
- **Joystick Movement**:  
  - Enables free movement using the VR controller joysticks.  
  - Smooth navigation for a comprehensive VR experience.

## Use Cases  
- **Physics Demonstration**: Experiment with throwing, bouncing, and shooting objects to observe realistic interactions.  
- **Locomotion Testing**: Test and compare teleportation with joystick-based movement.  
- **Interactivity Showcase**: Highlight VR capabilities like hand tracking and environmental interactions.

## Technologies Used  
- **VR Framework**: Unity Engine with XR Interaction Toolkit.  
- **Programming Language**: C#.  
- **Hardware**: VR headset and controllers compatible with Unity's XR systems (e.g., Oculus, HTC Vive).

## Installation and Setup  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the project files from the repository (if hosted).  

2. **Open in Unity**  
   Open the project using Unity (recommended version: 2021.3 LTS or later).  

3. **Build and Run**  
   - Connect your VR headset and ensure all drivers are updated.  
   - Build the project for your target platform (e.g., Oculus, SteamVR).  
   - Run the built application to test the environment.
